## Website

Welcome to my opinionated little corner of the internet! This is where I share my discoveries, the things I'm proud of, and the things I'm just learning about. Sometimes, I even use it as a journal.

While I am an expert in certain areas, this blog is opinionated and I may not always be right. I encourage my readers to always double-check my sources and form their own opinions. I don't claim to be better than anyone, I'm just a curious person who loves to learn and share what I've found.

Now, a little warning: I can be pretty direct, and sometimes even a little harsh. That's just the way I am, both online and in real life. But I'm also committed to being as inclusive as possible. That's why I've made this website lean and minimalistic, with no comment section. If you find something offensive or problematic, please don't hesitate to create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/b4nst/banst.ch/issues/new). I'll thoroughly review it and address it.

I'm aware that some of the design choices I've made may not be inclusive for everyone. That's why I've included an accessibility button on the nav bar that allows you to switch to a more inclusive style. I'm always learning and striving to do better, so if you notice something I've missed, please let me know on [GitHub](https://github.com/b4nst/banst.ch/issues/new). I also recommend using the 'Reader Mode' in your browser, I personally love it!

Thanks for stopping by! I hope you find something here that sparks your curiosity. ü§ó

## Author

Hey there! üëã

I'm banst, a space enthusiast who's all about building. You can currently find me over at [Loft](https://loftorbital.com), where I'm busy constructing infrastructure to break the ultimate frontier.
I'm also into crafting track bikes, from the frames all the way down to the smallest details.

When I'm not in orbit or in the garage, I'm hanging out online. Check out my code on my [GitHub](https://github.com/b4nst) üêô, my social shenanigans my Instagram [ba4e57](https://www.instagram.com/ba4e57/) üì∏, and my ramblings on my blog you're visiting right now.

When it comes to tech, the less the better. I'm a big fan of minimalism and simplicity, and I'm always looking for ways to streamline my workflow. Obviously, I'm the terminal type, and I'm a big fan of [neovim](https://neovim.io/).

I've got a pretty solid grip on [go](https://go.dev/), [cue](https://cuelang.org/), and [k8s](https://kubernetes.io/), and I'm always learning more. Right now, I'm diving into [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for embedded and network mischief.

And as I learn and grow, I'm also striving to be more inclusive and environmentally friendly in all aspects of my life. It's important to me to be aware of the issues we're facing in this modern world and to do my part to make it a better place.

So that's me in a nutshell. Nice to meet you!
